# Patients Drugs Classification
Data science project, in which we apply: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Feature Selection, and Multiple Regression model aiming to predict a car price.
## Data Description
We have the Automobile dataset "auto.csv". It was obtained through the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data.

The datasets has 205 rows and 27 columns containing the cars' characteristics such as 'symboling', 'normalized-losses', 'maker', 'fuel-type', 'aspiration',
'num-of-doors', 'body-style', etc.
## Project Overview
In this data science project, we will focus on applying an **exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing the data, and selecting the features**. In addition, we will train a multiple regression model aiming to predict the price of the car regarding its different properties. Finally, we will evaluate the model based on the MAE
the RMSE and the R2_Score.
